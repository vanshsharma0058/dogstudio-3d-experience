## DogStudio-3D Website

-DogStudio is a modern, interactive 3D website built using **React**, **Three.js**, **GSAP**, and **custom shaders**.  
-The project focuses on smooth scroll-based animations, immersive 3D models, and visually rich effects.

-This repository contains the source code for the DogStudio-3D website, which showcases our 3D modeling and animation services. The website is built using modern web technologies to provide an engaging user experience.
